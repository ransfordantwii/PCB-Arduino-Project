# PCB-Arduino-Project
This project is about Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The aim is to build a circuit from the arduino Uno 3 physically and then design a schematic using a software. Kicard will be used to build the schematic and all connections will be made on one board. Designs such as ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, seven segment LED and RGB LED will be built on the same board. The project is divided into five parts which is shown below:
# Part 1
Part one of this project was to build the circuit in the laboratory to make sure the individual circuits on the aduino board to be integrated is working perfectly.
# Part 2
Part two involves integration of four different codes for each circuit on the  board and running it on the Aduino  interactive developtment environment IDE. It was a successful one and the the final code for the whole circuit was conjoined together. 
# Part 3
Part three involves a virtual build up of the whole circuit design on a software. A schematic of the whole circuit was designed using KiCad software. Footprints of all the devices oon the board were accounted for and the final layout was don e successfully.
# Part 4
In Part four, the shcematic and layout were sent to a fabrication room to print the designs on a circuit board.
# Part 5
Part five is where all the all the components(devices) are soldered on the printed board and texted with the code.
