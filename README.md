# PCB-Arduino-Project
This project is about Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The aim is to build a circuit from the arduino Uno 3 physically and then design a schematic using a software. Kicard will be used to build the schematic and all connections will be made on one board. Designs such as ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, seven segment LED etc will be built on the same board.
